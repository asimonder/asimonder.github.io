Welcome to Marine Aero- & Hydrodynamics Laboratory led by <a href="/pi/">Dr. Asim Ã–nder</a> at <a href="https://maev.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en">Department of Marine Environment and Engineering</a> of <a href="https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/">National Sun Yat-sen University</a>. The lab conducts interdisciplinary research that lies at the interface of ocean engineering, applied mechanics, data and computational science. A primary objective is to solve geophysical and engineering problems involving complex multi-phase, multi-scale flows in the marine environment. Our main mission is to aid the understanding of underlying small scale processes controlling the global climate change and related extreme events, and to mitigate their effects with resilient structures and innovative green energy technologies.  

The current research interests include:
- <b> Air-sea interactions</b>: wind-wave interactions, gas and heat exchange, Langmuir circulations
- <b> Offshore wind energy </b>: metocean characterization, aero-hydro coupling, atmospheric-stability effects, land-sea transition
- <b> Tsunamis </b>: bottom friction, sediment transport
- <b> Oceanic/atmospheric turbulence</b>: large-eddy simulation of near-surface layers, Reynolds-stress modelling, non-equilibrium turbulence
- <b> Computational science </b>: machine-learning models for interfacial flows, adjoint methods, immersed boundary methods, adaptive methods
