The lab pursues innovative fluid mechanics and CFD research to solve problems involving multi-phase, multi-scale complex flows in the marine environment. The current focus is on:
- Air-sea interactions in planetary boundary layers
- Tsunami modelling
- Turbulence modelling
- Offshore wind energy

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
